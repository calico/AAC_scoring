# AAC_scoring

This repository includes the **second** pipeline for calculating
AAC scores from DEXA images used by Sethi et al (to-be-published).
[Another repository](https://github.com/calico/AAC_scoring) contains
the pipeline for the **first** method.  Both pipelines exclude
some images due to quality issues: Sethi et al only used images
for which **both** pipelines generated an AAC estimate for downstream
analysis (using the average of the two scores).
